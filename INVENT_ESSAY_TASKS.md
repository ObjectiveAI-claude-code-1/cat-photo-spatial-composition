Task 1 — Evaluate Spatial Proportion: Assess the relationship between the size of the cat and the amount of space that surrounds it within the frame. Determine whether the cat has been given an appropriate amount of room. Look for signs of too little space — aggressive or careless cropping that slices through ears, paws, or tail without artistic justification, making the image feel claustrophobic and cramped. Look equally for signs of too much space — a small cat lost in an expanse of empty floor, blank wall, or featureless sky, making the subject feel insignificant and adrift in its own photograph. The ideal is a spatial relationship where the cat feels prominent without feeling cramped, where there is enough breathing room for the viewer's eye to settle comfortably and for the environment to provide a sense of place, but not so much that the cat loses its authority within the frame. Consider that this balance is contextual: a cat in motion may warrant more surrounding space to convey energy, while a cat at rest may need less. The underlying principle is that the space should feel intentional, considered, and in service of the subject.

Task 2 — Evaluate Environmental Cooperation: Assess whether the surrounding area — the background, the objects, the environment visible in the frame — supports the cat as the subject or competes with it for the viewer's attention. Look for backgrounds crowded with competing objects that fragment the viewer's focus, causing the eye to bounce between elements rather than settling on the cat. Equally, recognize that a clean or softly rendered background is not the only path to cooperation. A richly detailed environment can serve the photograph beautifully when it is organized in a way that directs attention inward toward the cat — foliage that frames the animal, shelves whose lines draw the eye toward the subject, light that falls naturally on the cat. The question is not whether the background is simple or complex, but whether it cooperates. A clean background cooperates by stepping aside. A detailed environment cooperates by pointing back at the subject. A cluttered, chaotic background competes, and that competition always costs the photograph something. Evaluate how well the surrounding elements understand their role as supporting context rather than rival subjects.

Task 3 — Evaluate Subject Prominence: Assess the cumulative, holistic impression of whether the cat is the undeniable focal point of the photograph. This quality emerges from the interplay of spatial proportion and environmental cooperation. When the amount of space is well calibrated and the surrounding environment supports rather than competes, the result is a photograph where the cat feels significant — where the viewer's eye arrives at the subject naturally and stays there willingly. Determine whether the photograph conveys the feeling that the entire image exists in service of the cat. Prominence is not merely about the cat being large or centered — a cat can command a frame without filling it, and can hold attention without sitting dead center. Rather, prominence is the sense that the cat is the reason the photograph exists. When prominence fails, the photograph feels aimless: the cat may be technically present but does not feel like the point. It may be lost in too much space, buried behind clutter, or cropped so tightly it feels like a fragment rather than a subject. Score this quality by evaluating whether every element of the surrounding space quietly affirms the cat as the clear, significant, and commanding subject of the image.
