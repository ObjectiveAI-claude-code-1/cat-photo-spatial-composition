Evaluate the effective use of surrounding space in the cat photograph. Assess the space around the cat — the negative space, background, and environment — and determine whether it serves the subject or works against it.

The cat should be given an appropriate amount of room. Too little space — an aggressive crop that carelessly slices through ears, paws, or tail without artistic justification — makes the image feel claustrophobic and careless. Too much space — a tiny cat lost in an ocean of empty floor or sky — makes the subject feel insignificant, like a footnote in its own photograph. The ideal is a spatial relationship where the cat feels prominent without feeling cramped, where the environment provides context or atmosphere without overwhelming the subject.

Beyond the amount of space, consider whether the surrounding area supports or competes with the cat. A busy background full of competing objects can fragment the viewer's focus, stealing attention from the subject. A clean or softly rendered background lets the cat command the frame. However, cleanliness alone is not the standard — a richly detailed environment can work beautifully if it is organized in a way that still directs attention inward toward the cat.

Score highly when the cat feels prominent without feeling cramped and the surrounding space cooperates with the subject — when the environment provides context or atmosphere while still letting the cat be the clear focal point.

Score poorly when the space overwhelms the cat, making it feel insignificant; when it crowds the cat with careless cropping; or when it distracts from the cat with cluttered, competing elements that fragment the viewer's attention.
